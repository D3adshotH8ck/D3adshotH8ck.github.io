# My Home Lab Setup for Networking and Offensive Security

When you're working toward certifications like the **CCNA**, **CCNP Security**, or **OSCP**, your gear can either make you or break you. I started with what I had, and I’m building toward the beast setup I want — one step at a time.

---

## 🔧 Current Setup

**💻 Main Machine**
- **CPU:** Intel i5  
- **RAM:** 16GB  
- **GPU:** 1050RTX
- **OS:** Windows (with Kali Linux running in a VM)

It gets the job done — barely. Multitasking during labs or running heavier tools like Burp, Wireshark, or even a basic brute force session can push it to the limit. But for now, it keeps me in the game.

**🐱 Kali Linux**
- Running Kali daily as my offensive security environment  
- Used for TryHackMe, exploit dev, and scanning

**🧪 Packet Tracer**
- Cisco’s Packet Tracer is my go-to tool for labbing out CCNA exercises  
- Simulates routers, switches, and allows testing routing protocols without physical hardware

---

## 🔥 The Dream Setup (Coming Soon)

What I’m working toward:

**💻 Dell G16**
- **CPU:** i7  
- **RAM:** 64GB  
- **Storage:** 4TB NVMe SSD  
- **GPU:** RTX 4060  

This rig will let me:
- Run Kali + multiple VMs without choking
- Launch brute-force attacks without worrying about lag
- Practice red teaming scenarios at scale
- Build EVE-NG or GNS3 labs with tons of devices

## 🧠 Why a Home Lab Matters

You don’t need fancy gear to start — just enough power to get your reps in. But once you're deep into networking and offensive security, the need for **RAM, cores, and SSD speed** becomes real.

Every scan, packet capture, and simulation teaches something — and that's the real win.

> 💡 *Tip:* If you're on a low-resource machine, use Packet Tracer for networking labs and reserve your Kali VM for lighter offensive tasks until you upgrade.

## 🧱 What's Next?

Soon I’ll be sharing:
- My TryHackMe and Hack The Box walkthroughs
- Subnetting tips that finally clicked
- A deep dive into setting up Packet Tracer labs

Until then — build what you can with what you’ve got. The grind doesn't wait for perfect gear.
