Today marks the beginning of something serious.

I’ve officially started documenting my journey to becoming a world-class ethical hacker. Here’s what I’m tackling:

- ✅ CCNA (Networking Fundamentals)  
- ✅ TryHackMe (Hands-on labs)  
- ~~CCNP Security~~  
- ~~OSCP (The beast)~~

This blog is for my future self and for anyone else walking this same path. Expect detailed walkthroughs, raw honesty, wins, and rants.

Stay sharp. Follow along, and let’s get after it.
