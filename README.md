# Hash Identifier Tool

A simple web-based tool to identify common hash types (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) by analysing the length and format of a given hash string.

## Features

- Detects the hash type based on input length
- Validates that the input is a hexadecimal string
- Provides quick links to popular online hash cracking services for each hash type
- Clean, dark-themed UI inspired by the Hacker Jekyll theme
- Lightweight and easy to embed into blogs or websites

## How to Use

1. Enter your hash string into the input box.
2. Click the **Identify** button.
3. See the hash type identified instantly, along with a link to try cracking it.
